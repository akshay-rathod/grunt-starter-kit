# Grunt Starter Kit

This small repo is designed to make starting new projects or working on simple ideas faster and easier. Copy the repo into a directory, run a few commands, and you're off and running.

## Steps

1. Clone repo
2. Copy contents into desired directory
3. `cd` to directory in terminal
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `grunt`

This kit will compile Sass, autoprefix the CSS output, concatenate and uglify JavaScripts, and run a watch command to live reload all changes to `.scss` and `.js` files.

Feel free to fork and tweak to your own needs.
